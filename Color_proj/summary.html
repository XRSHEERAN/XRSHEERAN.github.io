			<h3>Introduction:</h3>
			<p style="opacity: 80%;font-family: arial;">I got this idea of color guessing game from a course I took with Udemy but implemented this project completely in my own way. Generally, I've done this color guessing game to practise DOM and html Layout. The game is relatively straight-forward. Given the RPG value on top of the page, the user's goal is to choose the right color from the colored blocks below. User could also change to difficulty of color guessing by clicking on hard or easy. I may do some change to the mode switching since currently it only increase the number of the blocks instead of adding closer looking colors. As you can see this is a quite intuitive one and just for fun :). </p>
