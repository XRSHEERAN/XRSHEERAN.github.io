<p>This animation shows a balance and two earths, one happy earth and another sad earth. It represent the pollution<br>
cost by car and other technology (for the assignment I drew a drone). Technically, this animation is hierarchical <br>
The balance is drawn on the canvas and moving accordingly, it has two children: left plate and write plate, these two<br>
plates move as balance rotates. Also the two plates each have their children; left: car and drone, right: tree and moon sun.<br>
While  car have its rotating wheels as children, drone has four rotating propellers and itself is rotating as well, the<br>
tree has its moving arms and the rotating sun has moon rotating around it. We can also adjust rotating and scales<br>
with the bar below.</p>
